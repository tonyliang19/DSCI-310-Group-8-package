## Project Summary

In this project, we will explore and predict students’ exam performance
about Electrical DC Machines based on their study time by using linear
regression (LN) and the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. This
result could help students gain insight into the necessary study time
for specific scores as well as help instructors better understand the
performance of students.

The repository with the analysis can be found
[here](https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-8)

This package contains the functions necessary for the analysis.

## Report

The analysis report can be found
