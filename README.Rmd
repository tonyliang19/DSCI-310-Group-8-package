## Project Summary

In this project, we will explore and predict students' exam performance about Electrical DC Machines based on their study time by using linear regression (LN) and the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. This result could help students gain insight into the necessary study time for specific scores as well as help instructors better understand the performance of students.

The repository with the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-8)

This package contains the functions necessary for the analysis.


## Report

The analysis report can be found [here](https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-8/blob/main/doc/student_performance_analysis_report.Rmd#). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of group8 from [GitHub](https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-8-package) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-8-package")
```
## Usage

The DSCI-310-Group-8-package has four functions here,

- num_na : a function that shows whether there is N/A value in the data frame and return to a number which shows how many N/A values in the input.

- summary_fun : a function shows a summary statistic for each column in the original input.

- visualize_vars : a function that test whether ggplot point graph of two variables from same date frame.

- wrangle_data : a function that test whether contains the necessary variables and if it is then returns to a tidy data frame.


By running the code block above on your R file. 

Attention: 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
```
Needs to used if devtools is not already installed in your local repository. Otherwise, it can be skipped
